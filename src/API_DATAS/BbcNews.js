                "content": "Moldova’s pro-Western president looks set to win the first round of a presidential race but has accused “criminal groups” of undermining a referendum on European Union membership. Nearly 95% of votes were counted in the EU referendum that asked voters to choose whether to enshrine in the country’s constitution a path toward the EU. About 52% of a total of 1.2 million ballots voted “no,” while 47% voted “Yes.” However, ballots cast among the country’s large diaspora were still being tallied and tended to favour the EU path. “Criminal groups, working together with foreign forces hostile to our national interests, have attacked our country with tens of millions of euros, lies and propaganda, using the most disgraceful means to keep our citizens and our nation trapped in uncertainty and instability,” said president Maia Sandu after about 90% of the votes had been counted. “We have clear evidence that these criminal groups aimed to buy 300,000 votes — a fraud of unprecedented scale,” Ms Sandu added. “Their objective was to undermine a democratic process.” Polls by WatchDog, a Chisinau-based think tank, show a clear majority of more than 50% support the EU path. The referendum needs a one-third turnout to be valid. If Ms Sandu fails to win an outright majority on Sunday, a run-off will be held on November 3 which could pit her against Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who is polling at around 10%. The two pivotal ballots are being held amid ongoing claims by Moldovan authorities that Moscow has intensified an alleged “hybrid war” campaign to destabilise the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections, and backing a major vote-buying scheme. US national security spokesman John Kirby echoed those concerns this week, saying in a statement that “Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration”. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. “In the last several months, Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars to influencing Moldova’s presidential election,” Mr Kirby said. “We assess that this money has gone toward financing its preferred parties and spreading disinformation on social media in favour of their campaigns.” In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently resides in Russia, which paid 15 million euros (£12.5 million) to 130,000 individuals to undermine the two ballots. Mr Shor, who was sentenced in his absence last year to 15 years in jail for fraud and money laundering in the case of 1 billion US dollars (£766 million) that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014, denied the allegations, saying “the payments are legal” and cited a right to freedom of expression. His populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended “more advanced training in guerrilla camps” in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Ms Sandu won the presidency, and a parliamentary election will be held next year. Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.5 million, applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations.",

                "description": "Ballots cast among the country’s large diaspora were still being tallied and tend to favor the EU path.",
                "content": "Moldova’s pro-Western president looks set to win the first round of a presidential race but has accused “criminal groups” of undermining a referendum on European Union membership. Nearly 95% of votes were counted in the EU referendum that asked voters to choose whether to enshrine in the country’s constitution a path toward the EU. About 52% of a total of 1.2 million ballots voted “no,” while 47% voted “Yes.” However, ballots cast among the country’s large diaspora were still being tallied and tended to favour the EU path. “Criminal groups, working together with foreign forces hostile to our national interests, have attacked our country with tens of millions of euros, lies and propaganda, using the most disgraceful means to keep our citizens and our nation trapped in uncertainty and instability,” said president Maia Sandu after about 90% of the votes had been counted. “We have clear evidence that these criminal groups aimed to buy 300,000 votes — a fraud of unprecedented scale,” Ms Sandu added. “Their objective was to undermine a democratic process.” Polls by WatchDog, a Chisinau-based think tank, show a clear majority of more than 50% support the EU path. The referendum needs a one-third turnout to be valid. If Ms Sandu fails to win an outright majority on Sunday, a run-off will be held on November 3 which could pit her against Alexandr Stoianoglo, a Russia-friendly former prosecutor general who is polling at around 10%. The two pivotal ballots are being held amid ongoing claims by Moldovan authorities that Moscow has intensified an alleged “hybrid war” campaign to destabilise the country and derail its EU path. The allegations include funding pro-Moscow opposition groups, spreading disinformation, meddling in local elections, and backing a major vote-buying scheme. US national security spokesman John Kirby echoed those concerns this week, saying in a statement that “Russia is working actively to undermine Moldova’s election and its European integration”. Moscow has repeatedly denied it is interfering in Moldova. “In the last several months, Moscow has dedicated millions of dollars to influencing Moldova’s presidential election,” Mr Kirby said. “We assess that this money has gone toward financing its preferred parties and spreading disinformation on social media in favour of their campaigns.” In early October, Moldovan law enforcement said it had uncovered a massive vote-buying scheme orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled pro-Russia oligarch who currently resides in Russia, which paid 15 million euros (£12.5 million) to 130,000 individuals to undermine the two ballots. Mr Shor, who was sentenced in his absence last year to 15 years in jail for fraud and money laundering in the case of 1 billion US dollars (£766 million) that went missing from Moldovan banks in 2014, denied the allegations, saying “the payments are legal” and cited a right to freedom of expression. His populist Russia-friendly Shor Party was declared unconstitutional last year and banned. On Thursday, Moldovan authorities foiled another plot in which more than 100 young Moldovans received training in Moscow from private military groups on how to create civil unrest around the two votes. Some also attended “more advanced training in guerrilla camps” in Serbia and Bosnia, police said, and four people were detained for 30 days. A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, a year after Ms Sandu won the presidency, and a parliamentary election will be held next year. Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.5 million, applied to join the EU in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 2022, and was granted candidate status that summer, alongside Ukraine. Brussels agreed in June to start membership negotiations.",

                "description": "Liam Payne was working on a number of television projects before his untimely death this week - and two major TV shows could now be in doubt following the tragedy",
                "content": "In a shocking turn of events, two major TV shows are now reportedly \"hanging in the balance\" following the tragic demise of in Argentina. The 31 year old heartthrob and sensation met his balcony at the CasaSur Hotel in Buenos Aires on Wednesday. Insiders have hinted that it could take anywhere from 10 to 15 days for his remains to be sent back to the UK. Before his heartbreaking exit, Liam was said to be knee-deep in telly work, including a gig on an programme. He was also tied to a documentary about boybands, but with his sudden passing, the fate of these ventures is now up in the air. Liam's recent stint as a judge on 's Building The Band, where he was on the hunt for the next big boyband, had fans buzzing. Spotted in Manchester this August, where try-outs were being captured on camera, the show was tipped by The Sun to hit Netflix screens next year. However, following the star's death, its future is now cast in doubt, with Netflix keeping mum on the matter for now, reports . Another potential casualty of the tragedy is the heavyweight docuseries Boybands Forever, a collaboration with Louis Theroux. This series delves into the highs and lows of boyband life, featuring the likes of One Direction, and includes dishing out behind-the-scenes tales of the band's formation. The programme is set to hit screens next month, but following the tragic news of Liam's passing, the Beeb might delay its release. Louis spilled the beans on the show, saying: \"It involves some of the icons of modern British pop - and we see them through their highs and lows.\" He went on to reveal: \"It's how they came together, the experience of sudden fame, the opportunity and temptations that came their way, conflicts within the groups, between the groups, and between the boys and their managers.\" \"It's a gripping fable about getting everything you dreamed of, and it not being what you imagined, centred on a generation of young men, and their managers, who were wildly successful and also immensely vulnerable, having the times of their lives and also in some cases cracking up.\" The Sun has also revealed that Liam and his squad were hashing out a deal for a behind-the-scenes doc about his post-1D life, but sadly, it didn't come off. In the wake of the sad event, insiders have shared that Liam's body will probably stay in Argentina for 10 to 15 days while they wait for the toxicology test results. When the probe wraps up, the singer's remains will be released to his family and flown back to England, as per reports from Argentina's press. This would translate to the possibility of laying down the funeral plans for early next month, following the return of the body to UK shores.",

                "content": "The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, on Sunday cancelled his trip to Russia for the Brics summit after a fall at home caused a minor brain haemorrhage. In a statement, the presidential office said Lula, 78, would participate via videoconference after receiving medical advice to temporarily avoid long-haul flights. He was initially scheduled to depart at 5pm on Sunday. Lula’s doctor, Roberto Kalil, said in an interview with GloboNews TV channel that the president had a fall that caused “great” trauma to the back of his head, requiring stitches and resulting in a “small brain haemorrhage” in the temporal-frontal region. “It’s a condition that will require repeat tests throughout the week. Any brain haemorrhage, theoretically, can worsen in the following days, so observation is important,” Kalil said, adding that Lula was doing well and could engage in normal activities. According to a medical report issued earlier on Sunday by the Sirio Libanes hospital in Brasília, Lula suffered a laceration to the “occipital region” of the back of his head on Saturday. The report said Lula “was advised to avoid long-distance air travel but is otherwise able to carry out his regular duties”. The government announced that Mauro Vieira, the foreign minister, was designated to lead the Brazilian delegation to the Brics summit, departing on Sunday. Gleisi Hoffmann, a congresswoman and president of Lula’s Workers party, said she had spoken with the president and that “he is doing very well, just avoiding a long trip”.",

                "description": "The tech billionaire handed out the first million-dollar prizes at Trump-supporting events over the weekend",
                "content": "Elon Musk handed out the first $1m cheques to attendees at events supporting Donald Trump, after promising to give one million dollars away each day to someone who signs his online petition backing the Constitution. The tech billionaire gave the first prize to an audience member reportedly called John Dreher at an America political action committee (PAC) event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which is aimed at rallying supporters behind the Republican presidential candidate. “By the way, John had no idea. So anyway, you’re welcome,” Musk said as he handed over the cheque. On Sunday he handed out a second one to Kristine Fishell at the Roxian Theatre in McKees Rocks, Pittsburgh. But questions have been raised over the legality of the cash payments. Brendan Fischer, a US campaign finance lawyer, told the Associated Press the giveaway risks breaching the law because registration to vote is a prerequisite to become eligible for the money. “There would be few doubts about the legality if every Pennsylvania-based petition signer were eligible, but conditioning the payments on registration arguably violates the law,” he said. It is a federal crime to pay people with the intention of inducing or rewarding them to cast a vote or to get registered, an offence punishable by prison time. The prohibition covers not only monetary expenditures, but also anything of monetary value like liquor or lottery chances, a Justice Department election-crimes manual says. Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in a post that Musk’s prize is “clearly illegal”. He cited a law which says: “Whoever knowingly or willfully gives false information as to his name, address or period of residence in the voting district for the purpose of establishing his eligibility to register or vote, or conspires with another individual for the purpose of encouraging his false registration to vote or illegal voting, or pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both...” Hasen added: “And who can sign the petitions? Only registered voters in swing states, which is what makes it illegal.” The petition Musk is asking people to sign reads: “The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments.” To be eligible for the $1m, petition signers must be a registered voter and live in one of the seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the America PAC website. The petition also offers $100 to each registered Pennsylvania voter who signs and $100 for referring a registered Pennsylvania voter to sign. Attendees of Saturday’s event had to sign the petition, which allows America PAC to garner contact details for more potential voters that it can work to get to the polls for Trump. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Musk’s plan to give money to registered voters in Pennsylvania is “deeply concerning” and “something that law enforcement could take a look at.” Musk started America PAC, a political action organization he founded in support of Trump’s presidential campaign. The group is helping mobilize and register voters in battleground states, but there are signs it is having trouble meeting its goals. The Harrisburg event was the third in as many days in Pennsylvania, where Musk is painting November’s election in stark terms and encouraging supporters to vote early and get others to do the same. He said on Saturday that if Harris wins, it will be “the last election.” He also said the two assassination attempts against Trump prove he is ruffling feathers and upending the status quo. Musk, ranked by Forbes as the world’s richest person, so far has supplied at least $75 million to America PAC, according to federal disclosures, making the group a crucial part of Trump’s bid to regain the White House. The entrepreneur behind carmaker Tesla and rocket and satellite venture SpaceX has increasingly supported Republican causes and this year became an outspoken Trump supporter. Trump in turn has said if elected he would appoint Musk to head a government efficiency commission. With agencies",

                "content": "Khamzat Chimaev just can not stop pulling out of fights but to no fault of his own. It all started during the COVID-19 pandemic when he first contracted the virus. The UFC fighter fell violently ill, suffered a lung infection, and had a lot more complications during this period. After that, things haven’t been the same for the Russian fighter. Most recently, he fell sick just days before his fight against Robert Whittaker at UFC Fight Night: Whittaker vs. Chimaev. He had to be admitted to the hospital after claiming to be ‘violently ill ‘ yet again. Although neither Khamzat Chimaev nor his team have spoken about any autoimmune disease or long-term illness, it is what the fans think he is suffering from. Up until now, apart from his bout with COVID-19, whenever he has fallen ill, it seemed to be some common illness like a cold or a lung infection. His team has not addressed why he keeps falling sick or any underlying factors behind it. All it does is make him look like an unreliable fighter to the fans who can never know if he will pull out of the fight or not. There is one fighter who seems to have an explanation for this though. His teammate Alexander Gustafsson believes he knows the reason behind his illness. Gustafsson decodes Chimaev’s health Gustafsson has trained with Khamzat Chimaev regularly and he knows exactly what happens inside his training camps. The Swedish fighter spoke out about ‘Borz’ constantly falling ill and asserted that there was a reason for it. He spoke about how easily the Russian fighter falls ill and said that that’s how his body reacts to training. According to Gustafsson, the cause of his falling sick so often could be because of how hard he trains during his fight camps. When one pushes the body to its limits and it does not get enough rest, which the body needs to recover, it becomes susceptible to all manners of illness. Besides, the massive weight cuts don’t help either. And according to the Swede, this is exactly what happens to Khamzat Chimaev. Now, there’s no way to know for sure since Chimaev hasn’t been officially tested by UFC doctors but hopefully, he keeps healthy and keeps fighting. Because there is a world champ in there, and fans would love to see him if he doesn’t suffer the same fate as the aliens from War of the Worlds.",

                "content": "Things went from bad to worse for the San Francisco 49ers as they lost yet another one of their important playmakers. The Niners not only left game week 7 with another loss against the Chiefs but also lost another offensive weapon in Brandon Aiyuk. The reports coming out indicate ACL and MCL Sprain in his right knee. Towards the end of the first half, QB Brock Purdy threw a pass on a crossing route to Aiyuk, who caught it and then attempted to advance down the field. However, during his attempt, Chiefs safety Chamarri Conner tackled him hard and low, hitting his right knee. Aiyuk clutched his leg and was immediately ushered off the field. Replays revealed the severity of the impact, sparking concern among fans—and rightly so. The recently minted member of the $30 million wideout club may have sustained a serious ligament injury, potentially ending his season depending on the extent of the damage. If it’s an MCL Sprain, he would likely spend 2-4 weeks on the sidelines. However, if it’s an MCL sprain + full-blown ACL tear, he will likely be out for 10-12 months. HC Kyle Shanahan, who spoke with the media, fears that it might be the latter. Both Deebo Samuel and Juan Jennings missed today’s game against the Chiefs due to illness and a hip injury, respectively. Christian McCaffrey has also been sidelined since the start of the season. Despite Brock Purdy’s strong performances without his star weapons, their absence was evident today. He struggled to find rhythm with the rest of the offense, throwing three interceptions and passing for just 212 yards—most of which came during garbage time. In their absence, the Niners would have to rely on George Kittle, returning rookie Ricky Pearsall, Jacob Cowing, Ronnie Bell, and Chris Conley. This marks the fourth loss of the 49ers’ 2024 season, leaving them 3-4. Meanwhile, their Super Bowl opponents from last year, the Chiefs, remain undefeated. The 49ers’ chances of making the playoffs this time around continue to deteriorate every week.",

                "content": "AUSTIN - Lando Norris said F1 stewards have to be more consistent with penalties after he lost a podium to championship rival Max Verstappen at the U.S. Grand Prix. Norris and Verstappen both ran off the circuit while they late in the race. Norris emerged ahead and finished the race infront of Verstappen on track, but he was relegated to fourth by a five-second time penalty. When asked if he understood the decision, Norris said: \"I don't.\" The Briton went on to reference his clash with Verstappen at the Austrian Grand Prix, where they and dropped down the order. \"He went off the track by defending, has overdefended and made a mistake, and therefore has gained from that. At the same time, because of that, I've had to go off the track. It's impossible for people to know if I could have made it on the track or I couldn't. \"You can't steward that kind of thing. But those are the rules. They seem to change, because it seems like it's quite inconsistent from say what happened in Austria, where Max didn't get a penalty and went off the track, gained an advantage. There's again inconsistency, but it's tough.\" Norris had started from pole position but had been pushed wide by Verstappen at the start, which the stewards did not investigate. \"I think both times, Max went off the track, he had a lot of commitment to keep me behind. The thing is with Max, you've got to commit. People don't understand that kind of thing. \"With Max, you can't just go half-hearted. Turn 1 is a bit harder to say, whether it's I didn't commit enough, but the fact that he committed so much speed in that he again went off the track, I mean I can't just dive up the inside of someone, run off, and then keep the position in normal running. \"But for some reason, it's completely OK in Lap 1 on Turn 1. It's a tough one. Yeah. I don't know. It hurts today.\" By giving up a position to Verstappen, Norris slipped further behind in the title race -- he is now 57 points adrift with five races and two sprints to go. \"It's a momentum killer,\" Norris said. \"The one guy I need to beat is Max, and that's the guy I didn't beat today. So it was an unsuccessful weekend all in all. But we gave it a good shot. I tried. It wasn't good enough, and we have work to do, and I have work to do on myself.\"",

With the drivers' I see it a bit in a different way. If we do everything perfect it will require a bit of luck to get that title, we cannot really rely on luck. \"The drivers' seems quite unlikely but I will believe it until it's mathematically impossible... but [it's] trickier.\"",

In , Antonio Conte's beat to stay two points clear of at the top of the league, while in Germany it's and going stride-for-stride at the summit. , and John Stones all scored goal of the month contenders, but it was 's hat trick in Bavaria that really stood out. What else did you miss around Europe this weekend? ESPN's Julien Laurens, Sam Marsden and Constantin Eckner recap all the action. There couldn't have been a more nightmarish weekend possible for Arsenal. While title rivals and both won, at and against , respectively, the Gunners lost their first game of the season in all competitions at Bournemouth. was sent off after just 30 minutes, the north Londoners' third red card in eight league games this season, and he will miss Liverpool's trip to the capital next weekend. Without the injured , Mikel Arteta's team never found their usual rhythm with the ball, while Bournemouth's efficient press put the visitors under a lot of pressure. Despite conceding two goals after the break, Arsenal still had their chances to return to London with something to show for their efforts, letting slip a particularly enticing opportunity with the match still scoreless. After that defeat, Arsenal are now three points behind City and four behind Liverpool. Absolutely everything went against the Gunners this weekend. For a clash between two promoted sides, we got an absolute treat on Saturday. Between them, Southampton and had only won once this season in 10 combined games, the Foxes getting the best of Bournemouth two weeks ago, so both teams knew how massive this encounter was. The Foxes were 2-0 down inside a half hour, they trailed by the same margin at the hour mark, and completed the 3-2 comeback win in the eighth minute of second-half stoppage time. It will undoubtedly be a turning point in their season. It wasn't the most beautiful of the weekend, but Stones' winner for Manchester City at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Sunday deserves our award for best goal because it sealed a massive victory. After being the hero who earned the champions a late point against Arsenal last month, Stones gave his team three more in the final minute at Molineux on Sunday, a result Pep Guardiola's team needed to take advantage of the Gunners' slip-up on Saturday and to keep pace with Liverpool. The big game of the weekend between Liverpool and Chelsea didn't disappoint on Sunday, despite a slow start, and there was room for only one hero: Salah. The international, whose form has been a bit inconsistent lately, scored and provided a wonderful assist for in the Reds' massive 2-1 win. The 32-year-old forward has now five goals and five assists in eight Premier League matches this season so far. and both won ahead of the season's first Clásico; but while Madrid made hard work of beating -- more on that in a moment -- Barça recorded a confidence-boosting 5-1 win over . There were two more goals for the league's top scorer, , making it 12 in 10 matches, and there were encouraging performances from this season's star man and midfielder . The best news of the matchday was the return from injury of , 349 days since he last played for Barcelona. His emergence to warm up got the loudest cheer of the night at Montjuic, and he was handed the captain's armband as he took to the field. The overriding sensation, as Barça celebrated 's second goal in the 88th minute, was just how young this team are. Torre, Pedri, Gavi, , , and are all in their early-20s. is just 17. Barcelona's future is bright; but before getting too carried away, let's see how they get on against Madrid next weekend. Real Madrid's 2-1 win over Celta Vigo had everything: a noisy atmosphere at a rain-soaked Balaidos, three outstanding goals from Mbappé, and , an age-defying cameo from -- who created the winning goal just three minutes after coming on as a substitute -- and an agonising, added-time miss from Celta's . Madrid won the game, but Celta showed their new team, full of homegrown talent, can compete with the best. Both Mbappé's long-distance curler and Swedberg's intricate team move for Celta -- which came after four first-time touches -- deserve a mention, but let's go for 's first LaLiga goal, which put 1-0 up at on Sunday. Atlético fought back to win 3-1, but that shouldn't undo the joy of Neyou's first-half rocket past into the top corner. Williams needed just two minutes, and four touches, to stake his claim for performance of the weekend in . His first goal in 's 4-1 victory over at San Mamés was a masterclass in economy of movement, turning and finishing before the defence had time to react. Seconds later, he had another, thrashing the ball past goalkeeper from an angle. Younger brother Nico Willians gets all the headlines, but Iñaki has never looked better. were in a bit of a slump before the international break, going winless in their previous three games following an impressive start into the season, but any doubts were put to rest on Saturday thanks to a 4-0 win over . The visitors, managed by former Bayern reserve team coach Sebastian Hoeness, wanted to make a statement at Allianz Arena, but instead Bayern steamrolled Stuttgart in the second half, with Kane scoring a hat trick. Those who have accused Kane of failing to show up in big games may look at the opponent and see more evidence to support their theory, but Stuttgart were last season's runners-up. Nevertheless, the international may just be happy to have his name on the score sheet again having gone goalless in his three previous games. Bayern are sitting at the top of the table, with in second place. These two teams, and potentially defending champions , seem to have the overall quality to compete for the German championship this season. While the arrival of manager Vincent Kompany has been a breath of fresh air for Bayern, and the record champions have every chance of reclaiming their throne, they won't escape from their rivals in the title race anytime soon. continue to have a rollercoaster of a campaign, and their 3-2 win over Heidenheim on Saturday was the embodiment of that. The game at Borussia-Park turned into an exciting back-and-forth, with Gladbach emerging as the winners thanks to two goals by in the second half. No matter the three goals or the three points, head coach Gerardo Seoane still hasn't managed to create the necessary defensive stability to lead Gladbach in the upper third of the table. Kleindienst's first goal in Gladbach's narrow win over Heidenheim was one of the highlights of the matchday. The 29-year-old, who recently made his first appearance for , converted a cross from with a beautiful and equally difficult back-heel strike, giving Gladbach the lead over his former team. If you score three goals in the marquee game of the weekend, you have undoubtedly earned the MVP award. Kane is still an elite striker, even if he does not always have the anticipated presence in games. For years, Bayern relied on Lewandowski to sink defences, and now they're counting on Kane to do the same on a constant basis. What else you missed this weekend Napoli's 1-0 win at means Antonio Conte's team are still top of the table, with nearest rivals two points behind them thanks to their own tight, 1-0 victory over at the Stadio Olimpico. In fact, there was no change at all in the upper echelons of the table, with all top-six teams recording victories, the most emphatic being 's 6-0 thrashing of . Napoli and Inter were both under pressure to deliver after , in third, had edged past a day earlier. A win for Napoli was by no means guaranteed, given that Juve and the had both already dropped points at Empoli this season. Conte wasn't happy with his team, calling them \"spectators\" in Sunday's first half, but things improved after the break, when 's penalty was decisive. Napoli finished a huge 41 points behind champions Inter last season. Under Conte, they're now resurgent league leaders. Cologne hope to only stay for one year in the 2. Bundesliga, but just like Schalke and Hertha Berlin the year before, they must realise that going up against the steadily evolving competition in that league can pose a serious challenge for any big-name club. The three-time German champions, who have been significantly hurt by a transfer ban imposed by FIFA, which will end on Jan. 1, and are managed by former boss Gerhard Struber, lost 5-1 at Darmstadt on Friday. Cologne are now 10th in the 18-team table. Given their defensive shortcomings, the decision makers in the Rhine metropolis may need to accept reality and either make a splash in the January transfer market or begin planning for at least another year in Germany's second division, which has become the home of so many of football's fallen giants.",

                "content": "McLaren's Andrea Stella criticised Formula 1 stewards on Sunday for what he said was an \"inappropriate\" U.S. Grand Prix penalty that seriously dented Lando Norris's title hopes. Norris was with title rival Max Verstappen for third place and overtook the Red Bull four laps from the end, with both cars running wide. The Briton, who had come off worse in a first corner incident with Verstappen on the opening lap after starting from pole position, did not give the place back and was then penalised, which dropped him back to fourth. \"My view is that the way that the stewards interfered with a beautiful piece of motorsport was inappropriate because both cars were off track, so both cars gained an advantage,\" Stella told Sky Sports television. The Italian said the decision could not be appealed and championship leaders McLaren had no alternative but to put it behind them. \"We double checked that both cars went off track. So for us there was no doubt that the manoeuvre was correct,\" he added when asked why Norris had not been told to give the place back. Red Bull principal Christian Horner naturally disagreed, calling it a \"slam-dunk\" decision and commending the stewards for acting promptly and ensuring the podium reflected the true result. \"For us it was crystal clear that the pass had been made off the track so he should have given the place back,\" he told reporters. \"He chose not to so therefore there was a penalty. For us it was very much a black and white scenario.\" Norris said the stewards' decisions were , with Verstappen over-defending, making a mistake but still gaining from it. \"I don't think you can appeal this kind of penalty, which is, again, a silly thing because they're just guessing and I don't think that's how stewarding should be done,\" he told reporters. \"I'm not complaining against them. I think it's just more the fact they don't see everything, understand everything, as well as we do when we're inside the car,\" added the 24-year-old, who is now 57 points adrift of Verstappen.",

                "description": "NHS staff and patients will have until the end of the year to submit their views, with the plan expected to be published next spring.",
                "content": "Billed as “the biggest national conversation about the future of the NHS since its birth”, members of the public will be able to share their views online via change.NHS.uk until the start of next year. The consultation is part of the Government’s plans to transform the NHS into a “neighbourhood health service”, shifting more care from hospitals to communities. The plan, expected to be published in spring 2025, will also see greater use of data and technology, with easier sharing of patient data, saving an estimated 140,000 hours of staff time every year. Announcing the consultation, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: “My mum worked for the NHS, my sister worked for the NHS, and my wife still works for the NHS – so I know first-hand how difficult it has been for staff, and for patients battling against a broken system for over a decade. But it’s time to roll up our sleeves and fix it. “We have a clear plan to fix the health service, but it’s only right that we hear from the people who rely on the NHS every day to have their say and shape our plan as we deliver it. “Together we can build a healthcare system that puts patients first and delivers the care that everyone deserves. “We have a huge opportunity to put the NHS back on its feet. So let’s be the generation that took the NHS from the worst crisis in its history and made it fit for the future.” Health Secretary Wes Streeting urged the public to “help us build a health service fit for the future”, saying he wants NHS staff and patients to have their “fingerprints all over” the 10-year plan. He said: “When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer, the NHS saved my life, as it has for so many people across our country. We all owe the NHS a debt of gratitude for a moment in our lives when it was there for us, when we needed it. Now we have a chance to repay that debt. “Today the NHS is going through the worst crisis in its history. But, while the NHS is broken, it’s not beaten. Together, we can fix it.” NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said it was “vital” that the service “innovates and adapts” as it faces “an unprecedented number of challenges”. She said: “The 10 Year Health Plan is a chance to make the best practice, normal practice across the country. “So, we will be carrying out the largest ever staff engagement exercise in NHS history and leaving no stone unturned as we seek to harness frontline views, alongside those of patients and the public, to ensure this happens. “It is your experiences – good, bad, and sometimes frustrating – that we need to help shape this once in a generation opportunity, so please get involved.” Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged the Government to show “ambition” in its plans, or risk the consultation “becoming a talking shop”. He said: “We know that primary care services across the country are at the brink of collapse due to the Conservative Party’s disgraceful neglect, with patients paying the price. “Whether it is sky-high GP waiting lists, endless ambulance response times, or a failure to diagnose cancer in time, none of these issues can be fixed without fixing the crisis in social care. “That is why the Liberal Democrats will make sure that social care is part of the debate and push for a cross-party solution to this crisis.”",

                "content": "Southern Miss has fired coach Will Hall, ending his tenure at 14-30 over four seasons, it was announced Sunday. Hall had a 14-30 record in his four seasons as coach of the Golden Eagles, who are 1-6 this season after Saturday's 44-28 loss to Arkansas State . He will be owed nearly $860,000, per his contract. He went 7-6 in his second season at Southern Miss, including a win in the LendingTree Bowl, but he has gone 4-15 since, prompting the administration to make a change. \"We are grateful to Will and his family for their dedication to Southern Miss over the past four years,\" athletic director Jeremy McClain said in a statement. \"Will poured his heart and soul into this program and into shaping these young men. Unfortunately, the results on the field didn't align with our shared goals and expectations.\" Assistant head coach Reed Stringer will take over as interim head coach. The Golden Eagles play at James Madison next week. Hall got high marks for building the culture and recruiting the area, but he just couldn't continue the trajectory he'd set during his second season. Southern Miss officials believe the job will draw a strong candidate pool, as it has a good tradition and championship ambitions. It sits in one of the country's most fertile recruiting areas and has a strong fan base. \"Our immediate focus is twofold: first, supporting our student-athletes throughout the remainder of the season, and second, conducting a comprehensive national search to identify the next leader for Southern Miss football,\" McClain said. \"This is a proud program with an outstanding history and a premier job in college football. We will find the next leader to usher us into a new era of championship success.\" The next full-time coach will be the program's fifth since 2012.",

                "content": "The United States Grand Prix stewards handed out four penalties for track limits infringements in today’s race. Advert | Become a Supporter & go ad-free The incident Pierre Gasly was penalised for resembled the Norris-Verstappen incident more than the others, though it occured at turn 15, not 12. Several details were similar: Gasly was trying to overtake a rival (Alexander Albon) on the outside, was ahead as they approached the apex but not when they reached it, and overtook his rival off the track. The key difference was that Albon, unlike Verstappen, remained within the track limits. The stewards’ verdict on Gasly was therefore very similar to the one they issued for Norris. In both cases the stewards noted the driver attacking on the outside no longer had the right to be left room by their rival. Poll: Did either driver deserve a penalty in Norris and Verstappen’s US GP clash? “Car 10 [Gasly] was overtaking car 23 [Albon] on the outside, was level with car 23 at the apex but fell back briefly prior to the exit of the turn,” the stewards explained. “Therefore under the Driving Standards Guidelines, car 10 had lost the ‘right’ to the corner. Accordingly as car 10 left the track and returned in front of car 23, it is deemed to be a case of leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage. “A five-second penalty is imposed instead of the 10 second penalty recommended in the guidelines because the driver of car 10 lost the right to the corner, albeit briefly, by only a very small margin.” The two other incidents which resulted in penalties occured at the same corner where Norris and Verstappen clashed. In both cases they involved a driver on the inside forcing another wide. George Russell was penalised five seconds for forcing Valtteri Bottas off and Yuki Tsunoda received the same for his incident with Alexander Albon. Advert | Become a RaceFans supporter and go ad-free The stewards issued identical verdicts on the two incidents, aside from the references to the drivers’ numbers. “The Driving Standard Guidelines provide that when overtaking on the inside the driver must not force the other car off the track and must leave a fair and acceptable width for the car being overtaken,” they stated. “This did not occur on this occasion. “However in mitigation, a five-second penalty is imposed instead of the standard 10-second penalty because the stewards determine that the forcing off track was not deliberate, and [Russell/Tsunoda] was in control of the car at all times.” None of the drivers were given penalty points on their licences, which has happened in some instances of drivers forcing rivals off or leaving the track and gaining an advantage this year.

                "content": "Diablo 4’s Rawhide and Iron Chunk drops have been bugged since Vessel of Hatred launched. Blizzard has finally announced a hotfix that should rectify the issue. Diablo 4 got a massive overhaul when the long-awaited Vessel of Hatred expansion arrived alongside Season 6 . Players got access to new mechanics , activities , and a brand-new class to build and tinker with. Unfortunately, these new inclusions arrived with a string of new bugs that Blizzard is slowly trying to iron out. Some are fun, like one that allows the new Spiritborn to hit for hundreds of trillions of damage . Others are a massive pain, like a bug that has made basic crafting materials extremely difficult to come across. Luckily for players, Global Director of Community for Diablo 4 Adam Fletcher has just announced that an upcoming hotfix will resolve the issues with Rawhide and Iron Chunks’ abysmally low drop rates. Team is checking into an issue with a quest items 'Villager's Remains' that is affecting some player inventories/player states. Separately, we plan on adjusting some of crafting materials such as rawhide/iron with a hotfix at the start of the week. The lack of basic crafting materials since the launch of Vessel of Hatred has been a major problem for Diablo 4 players for the last fortnight. Iron Chunks and Rawhide are usually available in abundance owing to their common rarity. Usually, players will amass a large quantity of both just for playing the game thanks to overworld drops and salvaging weapons and armor. Both materials are used in almost all of Diablo 4’s crafting mechanics and late-game upgrades require a lot. Players on the game’s Subreddit have shown evidence that Rawhide currently has an equal drop rate to rare and legendary materials like Veiled Crystals and Coiling Wards. “The fact that common materials are so hard to come by made me quit the season,” one player said of the issue. “Can’t be bothered farming for 2 hours just to roll on a single item.” While specific details of the fix weren’t revealed, Fletcher did announce that the hotfix would arrive “at the start of the week”. Related: Hopefully, this means that Diablo 4 players will not have to deal with this basic material drought for much longer.",

                "content": "When I first met my civil service team I asked them what needed to change in the Department and the answer was blank expressions and silence. I got the message – the civil service has it all ticking over nicely, thank you. This suits me because who wants to get involved in the nitty gritty of administrative reform? So I’m left kicking my heels. The devil makes work for idle hands, of course, and he’s always been a bit of a mentor to me, so I have been operating off-piste on a few schemes. Aiding and abetting my schemes is the absence of commercial nous and particularly high-tech nous, in my ministerial colleagues who come from the union, educational and economics worlds. This makes them as gullible about tech as an aborigine. I’ve persuaded the Defence Department that lasers can replace artillery and robots can replace soldiers; persuaded the Education Department that remote teaching can replace teachers; persuaded the Health Department that remote surgery can replace surgeons, computer-aided diagnoses can replace doctors and wearable health monitors can replace GP appointments while I’ve persuaded the Work and Pensions Department that they can replace their Civil Servants with an AI programme. Because all these proposals apparently reduce costs, ministers lap them all up like dozy kittens. I have dropped the names of a few companies in which I have an interest which can supply these replacement technologies. God knows how much it will cost the country if any of this gets implemented but, by the time the damage is done, my associates should have scooped some juicy contracts and trousered their ill-gotten gains. And Yours Truly will have pocketed his just rewards.",

                "description": "Times have changed, and what felt right to boomers doesn't always sit comfortably with today's millennial parents.View Entire Post ›",
                "content": "Millennials are the first generation of parents to have grown up in the digital era — and it shows. Today’s parents have access to infinitely more information than their parents had, and they hold themselves to a different set of standards. Some boomers may mock today’s touchy-feely gentle parenting , but these trends have grown out of insight into child development and the impact of childhood trauma. Many parents today believe that if you want to raise kind, respectful kids, you start by treating them with kindness and respect. A changed economic landscape means parents are also under more financial pressure. The cost of childcare continues to rise, with the average cost of a week of daycare going up 13% between 2022 and 2024. Families today are spending an average of 24% of their income on childcare — that’s more than triple the 7% the Department of Health and Human Services considers affordable. This problem, along with parents working longer hours and spending more time caring for their children, makes it no surprise that parents’ mental health is suffering. Back in August, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an advisory on parental mental health, citing “an intensifying culture of comparison” among the stressors weighing on parents, causing them to report significantly higher rates of stress than adults without children. Today’s parents are certainly looking for support wherever they can find it, online or within their own families. Oftentimes, grandparents want to be helpful but may struggle with all the ways parenting has changed since they raised their children. We asked millennial parents to tell us what they wish their parents understood. Here’s what they had to say. Times have changed. “The world is a different place from when we were raised, so parenting has to be different. The mental load is crazy, and usually both parents need to work, so the ‘traditional’ family life most of us grew in is obsolete (for the majority). The comments of ‘when you were young,’ no matter how well-meaning, add to the parental guilt of not being available for your child 100% of the time as a mother or not being able to provide financially by yourself as a father, and it really hurts.” — Lesley Cox “Millennials are navigating a different world when it comes to financial instability, work-life balance and social media pressures. It genuinely is harder being a parent now, especially when it comes to costs compared to back in the day, even accounting for inflation. Childcare expenses are astronomical and add to stress. Millennials wish their parents understood that raising kids today comes with different economic, social and cultural challenges and that comparison to the ‘way things were’ can feel invalidating.” — Dr. Mona Amin We expect an equal partnership. “A lot of boomer people, they’re so amazed at our partners and how much they participate in child rearing. They’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, they’re just the best dad!’ And I have a great husband, and he is a great dad, but it’s like, yeah , because he does the same things I do. I’m a great mom, too. But there’s so many kudos toward men, which I just think is funny. Their generation, she’s like, ‘Your dad didn’t change a single darn diaper.’ Well, I would not have let that fly. That’s insane. I’m just calling her out on it: ‘No, mom, this is called a partnership. He doesn’t get a party because he’s doing what is expected.’” — Taylor Wolfe Sometimes you need to expand the village. “I’ve noticed that my parents understand the importance of being and providing a ‘village’ to help me with my children and family. I do wish though that they understood that all help doesn’t always have to come from the family. Sometimes, to allow for everyone in the family to rest, hired help may be needed. It could be a nanny, babysitter or daycare. My parents feel that I shouldn’t pay for the help if they’re around. The issue is that, just like my husband and I, our parents need a break, and we respect that. If we have the means and access to outside help, it’s a huge privilege and an added expense that’s worth it. Responsibilities can be shared without guilt.” — Mya Morenzoni “I wish my parents knew that we have to parent so much differently than they did back in the day. We have to parent with paid help, whether that’s a nanny or au pair. The village is available, but at a cost.” — Natalie Robinson We speak openly about mental health. “Many millennials prioritize their own mental health and their children’s emotional well-being, embracing therapy, mindfulness and open communication about mental health. They want their parents to recognize that mental health is not a taboo topic but an integral part of raising happy, resilient kids.” — Dr. Mona Amin More is expected of us. “One of the biggest struggles seems to be getting my parents to understand that things that were ‘good enough’ or ‘fine’ for me or my siblings aren’t good enough anymore. From food to schoolwork to sports/extracurriculars and even what they’re watching ... there’s just a lot more involvement. And the crazy thing is that it’s also somewhat expected that millennial parents will be overly involved in their kids’ lives.” — Christina Rincon We place a high value on experiences. “We’re focused on creating life-long memories for and with our kids. Prioritizing vacations with and without kids is just as important as anything else in life.” — Natalie Robinson We respect our children and give them autonomy. “One thing that I wish that our parents understood is that we treat our children with respect and we understand that they are humans who are allowed to express their emotions. I think the best way to teach children to be respectful people is to give them that respect. That means allowing them to express their emotions and also to apologize to our kids if there’s a situation where I feel like maybe I handled it incorrectly. How can I get upset about my children not regulating their emotions if I can’t always be expected to regulate mine? So my kids are allowed to have bad days. They’re allowed to say, ‘Mama, I don’t agree.’ They’re allowed to choose who they want to hug and who they don’t want to hug. Those are the tough conversations we have had with our parents because how they want to parent our kids is not the same. In the moment, I’m not going to disagree with my mom or my in-laws, but it is a conversation after the fact: ‘Hey, you know how you responded in this moment? I’m not calling my child a crybaby. I’m not telling them to stop crying, to suck it up. We’re using different language.’” — Jamilla Svansson-Brown Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length.

The model turns the big 4-1 on Monday, October 21. She dressed as Marie-Antoinette, who has been famously attributed with saying, 'Let them eat cake.' Amber looked ready to party in a lacy pink minidress that showed off her generous cleavage. She completed her look with a white wig done in an old-fashioned updo befitting the era of the French Revolution during which Marie-Antoinette lived and garish makeup.

She revealed she was 'on weight-loss medication 'because I'm tired of being fat and photographing like a damn ogre,' but did not specify which one. The footage was shared by a fan on TikTok.

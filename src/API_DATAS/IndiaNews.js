                "content": "Srinagar, Oct 20 (IANS): Two labourers were killed and 5 others injured in a terrorist attack on a labourers camp in J&K’s Ganderbal district on Sunday, officials said. Officials sources said that terrorists attacked a camp of labourers of a private company engaged in building a tunnel between Gagangier and the tourist resort of Sonamarg. \"Two labourers have been killed and 3 are injured in this terrorist attack that took place around 8.15 p.m. The injured have been shifted for treatment to Srinagar city,\" an official said. Army and police have rushed to the spot and the area has been cordoned off to trace the assassins, officials said. Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the terrorist attack. \"Very sad news of a dastardly & cowardly attack on non-local labourers at Gagangir in Sonamarg region. These people were working on a key infrastructure project in the area. 2 have been killed & 2-3 more have been injured in this militant attack. I strongly condemn this attack on unarmed innocent people & send my condolences to their loved ones\", he said in a post on his X page. Sunday's attack comes two days after terrorists killed a non-local, identified as Ashok Chouhan, hailing from Bihar, in the Zainpora area of Shopian district. The terror attacks in the Kashmir Valley come after a spurt of terrorist activity, especially by hardcore foreign mercenaries, in hilly districts of the Jammu division including Poonch, Rajouri, Doda, Kathua, Udhampur, and Reasi, which witnessed a number of hit and run attacks on the army, other security forces and civilians in recent months, prior to the Assembly elections. Over 4000 trained commandos drawn from the elite Para commando force and those trained in mountain warfare have been deployed in the densely forested areas of these districts to prevent the terrorists from carrying out ambush attacks and then hiding in the difficult forest areas. In addition to the deployment of the army and the CRPF in these mountainous districts, police have also issued automatic weapons to the village defence committees (VDCs). The VDCs are groups of civilians trained to handle weapons to protect their villages and families from terrorists in remote, inaccessible areas of the Jammu division.",

                "content": "Ottawa, Oct 20 (IANS): In his first reaction after being withdrawn by New Delhi following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's continued \"hostility\" towards India, senior diplomat and High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma on Sunday termed the allegations levelled by Ottawa as \"politically motivated\" with no evidence whatsoever presented by the Canadian government of India's alleged involvement in last year's killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. \"Nothing at all. No evidence was presented. Politically motivated,\" Verma told Canada's CTV ahead of his departure from the country. Earlier this week, India decided to withdraw its High Commissioner and \"other targeted diplomats and officials\" from Canada after the Trudeau government - in what was termed as \"preposterous imputations\" by New Delhi - suggested that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats are 'persons of interest' in a matter related to an investigation in the country. \"If Mr. Trudeau or his colleagues know about it, is it not a crime not to file a charge sheet? Is it not a crime not to go by the judicial process? On what basis do they want to question me... If you are a defendant, for example, which I am not, then you would be shared with evidence and that happens even if you are caught for a petty crime. If I'm going for an interrogation I need to know what I am interrogated for. I need to know what evidence you have so I go prepared,\" Verma told the Canadian network when asked about India's refusal to join the so-called ongoing investigations. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had slammed Ottawa for casting aspersions on Verma - one of India's senior-most serving diplomats with a distinguished career spanning 36 years and who has been an Ambassador in Japan and Sudan, while also serving in Italy, Turkey, Vietnam and China - terming them as \"ludicrous\" which deserved to be treated with contempt. During the interview, Verma made it clear that the Indian government has \"never\" targeted individuals with the intent of causing their death. New Delhi has been asserting for a long time that the Trudeau government has \"consciously provided\" space to violent extremists and terrorists to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada. As it announced its decision to withdraw Verma and other diplomats on October 14, India had underlined that, in an atmosphere of extremism and violence, it had no faith in the current Canadian Government's commitment to ensure their security. \"The first point is show me the evidence and I have been talking about it from the very first day... Also, do we want to know what the Khalistani elements are doing in Canada. Yes, that we have to know. It is our national interest and the core concern with Canada which is trying to tore up the Indian territory. So, if the Canadian politicians are so novice that they want me not to know what my enemies are doing here, then they don't know what international relations are all about,\" Verma told CTV. On Wednesday, while testifying before the country's foreign interference inquiry, Trudeau had admitted that Ottawa had some intelligence inputs and no hard proof before accusing India of killing Nijjar. \"At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof,\" Trudeau admitted in an on-camera hearing before the committee. Interestingly, Trudeau continues to walk on thin ice, both at home and abroad, with many leaders from his own party and several Members of Parliament planning to go beyond just publicly expressing dissatisfaction with his leadership and getting ready to officially demand his resignation in the coming days. On Thursday, it was reported by the Canadian media that at least 20 MPs have agreed to put their names on a demand to oust Trudeau - a move which it said appears to be \"quickly snowballing into a serious effort\" to force him out. India has made it clear several times that Trudeau has been working on a \"deliberate strategy\" - of smearing India for political gains. \"What we have heard today only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along - Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats. The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,\" said Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday.",

                "content": "Bhubaneswar, Oct 20 (IANS): The Special Relief Commissioner Deoranjan Kumar Singh on Sunday said the state administration is all prepared to face the probable cyclonic storm named ‘Dana’, likely to be formed off the Odisha coast on October 23. Speaking to media persons after a review meeting chaired by Chief Secretary, Manoj Ahuja here on Sunday, SRC Singh said, “The administration is fully prepared to face the cyclone situation. It has always been the aim of the state administration to ensure ‘Zero Casualty’. I appeal to all the people to remain alert but not get panicky unnecessarily as we have sufficient time till October 23 when the cyclonic system is likely to be formed.” He also said the state government is in touch with the Central government and will provide all the required assistance and help to the state. He said that the teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF), Fire services and The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are also ready for deployment in the vulnerable areas. The district collectors have been instructed to hold a meeting at their end tomorrow (Monday) morning and apprise the state administration about their requirements for the number of ODRAF, Fire and NDRF units for deployment. The meeting will be attended by the Superintendents of Police and line department officers of the concerned district. The collectors have also been instructed to deploy the ODRAF, NDRF and Fire services units at vulnerable places at the block level by Tuesday. Singh stated that more units of NDRF will be requisitioned from the centre and other states if required. “The fishermen have been advised not to venture into the sea off Odisha Coast and adjoining North Bay of Bengal from October 21 to 26, 2024. District & concerned Departments have been instructed to operate control rooms on a 24x7 basis,” added the SRC office sources. The fishermen who are in the sea for fishing have been advised to return to the coast as soon as possible. As per reports, the collectors have been directed to keep the cyclone shelters in their concerned districts in readiness. The state administration also directed the collectors to ensure the provision of drinking water and lighting arrangements. The collectors have been instructed to shift people staying in low-lying and other vulnerable areas to the nearest cyclone centres. “Districts under red, orange & yellow warnings to remain in readiness to meet any eventuality, particularly water logging/ landslide in hilly areas. Continuous vigil of low-lying areas, dewatering wherever required including urban areas may be taken up. Avoid movement in affected areas, and stay in a safe place,” advised the office of SRC on Sunday. The collectors have also been instructed to shift Pregnant women whose Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD) falls in the next two weeks to the nearest hospitals. SRC Singh informed the media persons that the leaves of all state government staff have been cancelled and they have been directed to remain at their respective places and perform their duties. On the other hand, the State Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Krushna Chandra Patra on Sunday warned of stringent action against those who will be found involved in black marketing and hoarding of essential commodities in view of the cyclone.",

                "content": "New Delhi, Oct 20 (IANS): The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), which represents 4 lakh distributors across the country, on Sunday said it has written to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) about unfair practices like predatory pricing by quick commerce players like Blinkit, Zomato, Swiggy, and others. The leading distributors’ body said, in the letter, that \"Q-com platforms operating dark stores appear to intentionally bypass regulations governing inventory-based e-commerce\". \"Predatory pricing, deep discounting, and monopolistic tendencies lead to unfair competition, making it impossible for traditional retailers to compete or survive,\" it added. By exercising significant control over their inventory, these platforms seem to violate the law in both letter and spirit, the association’s letter read. The letter mentioned challenges being faced by the traditional supply chain due to the rapid growth of quick commerce, especially the selection of these platforms as direct distributors of FMCG companies. In August, the AICPDF had written to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry about the rapid growth of the quick commerce industry which is hurting traditional distributors. Requesting the CCI to start a thorough probe into the operational model of quick-commerce platforms, the distributors’ body asked the government regulator to implement protective measures for traditional distributors and small retailers. \"Implement protective measures for traditional distributors and small retailers to safeguard their interests,\" the distributors’ body urged the CCI.

                "content": "Guwahati, Oct 20 (IANS): The Congress on Sunday announced candidates for four Assembly constituencies in Assam where bypolls on November 13. However, the opposition party has refrained from announcing a candidate for the Behali Assembly segment which is also heading for by-elections, hinting about accommodating its ally CPI (M-L). By-elections in five assembly constituencies — Dholai, Samaguri, Behali, Bongaigaon, and Sidli became imminent following the elections of five legislators in the lower house of the parliament in this year’s Lok Sabha polls. Congress has given party tickets to Dhrubajyoti Purakayastha in Dholai, Sanjib Warle in Sidli seat, Brajenjit Sinha in Bongaigaon and Tanzil Hussain in Samaguri assembly constituency. The Dholai assembly constituency is reserved for the Scheduled Caste (SC) community and the Sidli seat is reserved for the Scheduled Tribe (ST). Except in Samaguri, where Congress heavyweight Rakibul Hussain has been winning since 2001, the rest of the four seats are with the BJP-led alliance. Tanzil Hussain is the son of Rakibul Hussain. The senior Congress leader ousted the three-time AIUDF MP and party chief Badruddin Ajmal in the Dhubri Lok Sabha seat with a margin of more than 10 lakh votes in this year’s Lok Sabha polls. The Congress leadership kept trust in Rakibul Hussain and gave a ticket to his son in Samaguri. The BJP earlier announced candidates for three seats — Dholai, Samaguri and Behali. Diplu Ranjan Sarma has been given the ticket in Samaguri while Diganta Ghatowar and Nihar Ranjan Das will fight for the BJP in Behali and Dholai assembly segments respectively. BJP’s former cabinet minister Parimal Suklabaidya successfully contested in the Silchar Lok Sabha seat and his earlier assembly seat Dholai was vacant. Meanwhile, another senior BJP leader Ranjit Dutta was elected to the lower house of the parliament this time. He was representing the Behali seat in the assembly. BJP’s two allies — Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) will contest polls in Bongaigaon and Sidli Assembly constituencies respectively.",

                "content": "Hyderabad, Oct 20 (IANS): Captain Arjun Deshwal led from the front as former champions Jaipur Pink Panthers overcame Bengal Warriorz 39-34 in a tightly-contested and highly entertaining match in Season 11 of the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) at the GMCB Indoor Stadium, Gachibowli, here on Sunday. The Jaipur Pink Panthers had to work hard and eventually managed to win the contest with Deshwal scoring 15 points while Nitin Dhankar registered 13 points for Bengal Warriorz. Iranian star Fazel Atrachali, who joined the franchise following the Players' Auction, and the Bengal Warriorz began the game very well, with the defensive unit working in tandem to foil a flurry of Jaipur Pink Panther attacks in the early exchanges. Both sides were patient in the first phase of play, with the Bengal Warriorz working hard to hold onto a slender lead. But at the midway stage of the first half, the Jaipur Pink Panthers captain Deshwal wrestled the momentum away from the Warriorz. Shortly after, a solid tackle by Abhijeet Malik helped inflict an All Out on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers storm into the lead. And even though the Bengal Warriorz fought hard after that, it was the Jaipur Pink Panthers who finished the first half with a 3-point lead. At the half-time break, the Jaipur Pink Panthers led 21-18. The two sides began cautiously in the second half as well as they weren’t keen on conceding any ground. While Fazel Atrachali led the Bengal Warriorz defence brilliantly, Arjun Deshwal was his talismanic self for the Jaipur Pink Panthers. With just under 10 minutes left in the contest, Abhijeet Malik inflicted an All Out on the Bengal Warriorz, which helped the Jaipur Pink Panthers extend the lead to a four-point one. At this point, the score read 29-25 in favour of the Jaipur Pink Panthers. It was an action-packed final phase of the game as Nitin Dhankar brought Bengal Warriorz right back into the contest. The Jaipur Pink Panthers, who seemed to be one step ahead all through up until then, were suddenly on the back foot. But it was Abhishek K.S.’s super tackle that sealed the contest for the Jaipur Pink Panthers, who walked off the mat with a closely contested win.",

                "content": "Imphal/Guwahati, Oct 20 (IANS): The Indian Army organised a befitting commemorative program on Sunday in two Manipur districts to pay homage to the gallant actions of the soldiers who laid down their lives while guarding the nation during the India-China War of 1962. A defence spokesman said that one commemorative program was held at Khurkul in Imphal West District while another one was organised in the Bethel High School in Moreh, Tengnoupal District, which shares a border with Myanmar. The events were conducted to ignite a sense of patriotism and reverence for the Indian armed forces. The spokesman said that the program commenced with a solemn tribute to the brave hearts by lighting a lamp. A comprehensive presentation was conducted highlighting the historical significance of the day recounting the valiant saga and inspiring stories of the heroes in the true tradition upholding the ethos of the Indian Army. The audience, composed of young students and common people was encouraged to draw inspiration from the gallant actions and selfless service for the motherland. In a separate development, the historic Indian Air Force (IAF) and Uttarakhand War Memorial (UWM) car rally covering 7,000 km, arrived in Bagdogra (West Bengal) on Sunday amidst a warm welcome by Air Warriors and children. Defence spokesman said that this iconic IAF car rally was flagged off by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on October 1 National War Memorial in New Delhi. The Mega car rally officially started on October 8 from the Air Base at Thoise in Ladakh and is planned to culminate on October 29 at Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh, he said. This rally team would now be heading for Guwahati, which is also known as Gateway to the northeast region, on October 22 via Hasimara. The team is scheduled to reach Guwahati on October 23 before its final journey towards Tawang. The rally on 14 Maruti Jimny 4×4 vehicles is being driven by Senior Air Warriors, Army Officers and Air veterans. The car rally is being led by Wing Commander Vijay Prakash Bhatt posted at the Directorate of Adventure, Air Headquarters. Fuelling the spirit of “Vayu Veer Vijetha”, the rally from Thoise to Tawang aims to inspire youth during interactions en route. As the nation is also celebrating this year as the “25th year of Kargil Vijay Diwas”, the team members are also committed to visiting war memorials en route and paying tribute to the fallen brave hearts during this unique journey, the spokesman stated.",

                "content": "Guwahati, Oct 20 (IANS): Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Sunday asserted that the present BJP government initiated a drive to give land rights to the indigenous people of the state, a first undertaken by the ruling dispensation in 75 years after Independence. “Immediately after we assumed office, we set out on a mission to provide land rights to indigenous communities in Assam- an exercise undertaken after 75 years of independence. On 2 October 2021, Mission Basundhara was born with this vision,” the Chief Minister said. He further stated that after setting out to implement this mission, the state government was astounded by the unprecedented number of applications, which were received from different beneficiaries. “This receipt of applications thereby validated the state government’s efforts of the land-related initiatives in Assam,” the Chief Minister said adding that the state government disposed of eight lakh applications in nine months under the first instalment of Mission Basundhara. Sarma added that realising the immense potential, especially in conferring land rights to the Indigenous people of the state, the state government launched the second edition of Mission Basundhara in November 2022 and gave land rights to over two lakh Indigenous people within one year. “Through this comprehensive mission, we aim to allot land ownership to priority groups at the earliest and bring transparency to the various land-related services. The third edition of Mission Basundhara will be another firm step taken by our government to safeguard the land rights and the identity of the people of Assam”, he said. On Sunday, the Chief Minister launched Mission Basundhara 3.0 to provide land rights to Indigenous people, at a function held at Srimanta Sankardev Kalakshetra here today. Under this initiative, steps will also be taken to digitise various land-related services and publish maps for the benefit of the people of the state as several new rules have been implemented to simplify the process of giving land rights to the people. The Chief Minister moreover said that to be entitled to land rights under Mission Basundhara - three-generation ancestry is required. However, people belonging to SC, ST, Tea Tribes and Gorkhas will not be required to prove three-generation ancestry as they are the sons of the soil. He also mentioned that the premium rate was reduced to 3 per cent of zonal valuation for city dwellers. He moreover announced that his government would shortly introduce unprecedented land reforms and issue Land Passbooks to all landholders. He further observed that through conferring land pattas the State government is strengthening its resolve of ‘Jati, Mati and Bheti’ (identity, land and base). Highlighting the services that will be available, the Chief Minister said that Mission Basundhara will enable review of MB 2.0 cases pending clarification, end-to-end digitisation of annual pattas to periodic pattas conversion with rationalised premium rates in urban and peripheral areas, one-time conversion of tea grant land to periodic patta etc. Sarma, moreover, said that in the coming days, the state government will launch many more initiatives which have the potential to revolutionise the convenience of the people of the state. Meanwhile, the Chief Minister also launched the Revenue Department’s Digidoc, a digital directory for non-registrable and optional registrable documents. The directory will streamline services, reduce processing time, and enhance public convenience and improve accessibility and efficiency.",

                "content": "Daijiworld Media Network – Mangaluru (MS) Mangaluru, Oct 20: Heli tourism has made waves in Karnataka, and now the New Mangalore Port Authority (NMPA) and the state tourism department have plans for introducing it in Mangaluru. If the plans materialise, foreign tourists arriving on cruise liners at NMPT will be the first passengers to experience the city via heli tourism. The NMPA had taken steps toward introducing heli tourism in Mangaluru many years ago; however, several issues, including maintenance, delayed the project. This time, the proposal has been sent to the state tourism department, which has given it the green signal in light of financial development as well as tourism growth. Around 8,000 foreign tourists visit the city via cruise liners to NMPT from December to May. The aim is to transport foreign tourists by helicopter to tourist spots in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi from the helipad located at NMPA. The cruise liners arrive at NMPT mostly at 8 am and leave the port around 6 or 7 pm. During this eight-hour window, tourists typically visit temples, churches, and mosques. However, through heli tourism, they will have the opportunity to explore attractions in neighboring districts as well. According to tourism department officials, heli tourism will foster all-round development. In the meantime, the tourism department is outlining fare charges for heli tourism. The first phase includes a list of tourist spots in Dakshina Kannada district, with plans to cover other districts later. Salma K Pahim, secretary of the Karnataka Tourism Department, said, “NMPA has shown an inclination to begin heli tourism in coastal Karnataka. Many works in this direction are completed. Heli tourism will begin soon. In addition, we have received demand for heli tourism from various parts of the state.”",

The summit is the first since the expansion of the group to nine members, with Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, and the UAE joining this year after being offered membership in the 2023 summit in South Africa. Argentina and Saudi Arabia were also invited but the former declined after a change of government, while the latter is yet to respond. PM Modi will visit Russia from October 22-23 at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to attend the 16th BRICS Summit, being held in Kazan, under the chairmanship of Russia, the MEA said. The summit, themed \"Strengthening Multilateralism for Just Global Development and Security\", will provide an important platform for leaders to discuss key global issues, it said, adding that the Summit will offer a valuable opportunity to assess the progress of initiatives launched by BRICS and to identify potential areas for future collaboration.

                "content": "Kolkata, Oct 20 (IANS): Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez scored late in the second half as Kerala Blasters FC pulled off a memorable 2-1 victory over Mohammedan SC at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan on Sunday, marking the first time in 27 games that they have won an away match after conceding first in the Indian Super League (ISL). Two second-half strikes from Kwame Peprah and Jesus Jimenez saw Mikael Stahre’s men secure their third consecutive victory in Kolkata, a feat they had never achieved in the competition. Mirjalol Kasimov handed Mohammedan SC the lead, but the visitors showed resilience in the second half to produce a come-from-behind victory in the 2024-25 edition of the competition. The visitors were off the blocks quickly, as Noah Sadaoui found the right tune from the start. The Moroccan posed all sorts of trouble for the Mohammedan SC backline, especially after combining with Adrian Luna, who was pulling the strings from midfield. However, the hosts weathered the early storm brilliantly and gradually imposed themselves on the match's tempo. In the 20th minute, Mohammedan’s pillar in defence, Joseph Adjei had to be substituted after suffering an injury. Andrey Chernyshov turned to French defender Florent Ogier to replace the Ghanaian. The next 10 minutes saw the hosts dominate possession and also create a few chances. Their persistent nature in attack was rewarded when Kerala Blasters FC's debutant custodian, Som Kumar brought down Franca in the penalty area in the 27th minute, handing a penalty to Mohammedan SC. Mirajlol Kasimov stepped up and converted from the spot to hand a crucial lead to the hosts. Mikael Stahre’s men didn’t bog down after conceding the goal, they were more spurred on to equalize. In the 34th minute, they almost managed to do so as Jesus Jimenez wriggled his way past multiple Mohammedan SC defenders before pulling the trigger. But the Spaniard’s long-range effort was denied by the crossbar. The second period saw both teams trying to take control of the possession in midfield. But the game swayed in the favour of the Blasters by Kwame Peprah’s introduction in the 64th minute. Within three minutes, the forward came up with the equalizer, latching onto a cross from Noah. Peprah was quick to react to the cross, leaving his marker, Zodingliana Ralte in complete awe before tucking it past Padam Chettri in goal. Riding on the positive momentum of scoring an equaliser, the Blasters enjoyed the lion’s share of possession and also created a flurry of chances. They eventually secured the lead in the 75th minute when Naocha Singh found Jimenez in the penalty area with a beautifully weighted cross from the left flank. The Spaniard rose the highest, beating Ogier in the air and eventually heading it past Chettri. Mohammedan SC’s best chance of coming back into the game fell to Lalremsanga Fanai in the stoppage time when he combined with Cesar Manzoki. The former was through on goal but his eventual effort was brilliantly kept out by Som Kumar, who also became the fourth youngest goalkeeper to start a game in ISL. His last-ditch save was enough to see the Kerala Blasters FC home as they clinched their second win of the season. Mohammedan SC will host Hyderabad FC at home on October 26 while Kerala Blasters FC will be in action on October 25 against rivals Bengaluru FC in Kochi.",

One Bini Muduli of Malkangiri district has proven it by clearing the Odisha Civil Service Examination-2022. With this, she also scripted a history and became the first girl from the Bonda community in Mudulipada of Bonda Ghat. The other reason what surprised everyone about Bini Muduli, the daughter of a cook and an Anganwadi worker, is that she cleared the prestigious exam without any coaching. She preferred for self-study and watched YouTube videos to prepare herself. Bini is the daughter of Ram Muduli, a cook at Mudulipada High School, and mother Sunamani Kirasani, an Anganwadi worker, is a native of Khemaguda village and belongs to the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG). She completed her schooling at Mudulipada Primary Shool. Then moved to the Malkangiri-based Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) and completed her Plus Two. Later, she did her graduation from Bikram Dev College in Jeypore and became an Ayurvedic assistant. After deciding to appear for the Odisha Civil Service Exam, Bini focused on self-studies and used YouTube videos due to financial constraints.

Key Performances Drive New Zealand’s Victory New Zealand set a challenging target of 159 runs, finishing at 158-5 after South African captain Laura Wolvaardt opted to bowl first. Amelia Kerr was the standout performer for New Zealand, scoring 43 runs off 38 balls.

                "content": "Millions of Cubans faced another day without electricity on Sunday following a partial grid failure that struck overnight, exacerbating an ongoing crisis and raising doubts about the government’s ability to restore power effectively. Partial Grid Collapse Confirmed Lazaro Guerra, Cuba’s top electricity official, announced the partial grid collapse affecting western provinces, including Havana, late Saturday. Technicians are currently working to address the issue, although no timeline for power restoration has been provided. Havana Completely Dark The capital, home to nearly two million residents, was reported to be entirely without electricity early Sunday. Many Cubans queued for subsidized food rations while contemplating the situation outside their homes. Power Plant Back Online According to state-run digital news outlet CubaDebate, the Antonio Guiteras power plant, the nation’s largest, was brought back online Sunday. It is expected to aid in restoring electrical service throughout the day. Third Failure Marks Major Setback The recent grid failure represents a significant setback in government efforts to restore power amid an already critical situation involving severe shortages of food, medicine, and fuel. Hurricane Oscar Adds to Concerns As Hurricane Oscar approached northeastern Cuba, fears mounted over the potential for further complicating the government’s power restoration efforts. The storm was labeled as “extremely dangerous” by Cuba’s meteorological survey, with maximum winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kph). History of Grid Failures Cuba’s national electrical grid first experienced a shutdown on Friday after the largest power plant went offline, resulting in widespread chaos. This was followed by another collapse Saturday morning, and although authorities reported some progress later, a third failure ensued. Protests Erupt Amid Crisis Tensions escalated as two small protests were observed late Saturday, triggered by the power outages. Videos from the capital began circulating on social media, although their authenticity could not be verified. Internet Connectivity Severely Affected Internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported a sharp decline in internet traffic on Saturday, as extensive power outages hindered residents’ ability to charge devices and connect online. Blame Game Continues Cuba’s government attributes the ongoing electricity crisis to a combination of aging infrastructure, fuel shortages, and high demand. The situation is compounded by U.S. trade sanctions, which they argue hamper access to necessary fuel and spare parts. The U.S. denies any involvement in the failures.
